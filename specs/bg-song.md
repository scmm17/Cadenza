## Implementation
- Create new new NoteCollections for the scales and chords
- Create chord progressions, using arpeggio chords
- Create an aleatoric melody
- Use Fragment sequencing for the song structure, 100% on each sequence to play straight through
- Ensure the correct intervals for the chords and scales
- Run the code to ensure no crashes. I will break execution if too long

## Instrumentation
- Use the V3 device.
- Choose presets from the B3 preset list
- Instruments: Mandolin, slide steel giutar, violin, bass violin
- I will make final instrumn
- Mandolin is the lead instrumentation choices because you can't hear

## Rhythms
- Use the probability strings method
- Choose sensible initial values for probabilities and mutations ranges

## We will iterate to make the music better
